Working with QuSpin `basis` objects
-----------------------------------

This tutorial shows how to define and interpret `basis` objects.  

In particular, we discuss how to define and read off physical states from the basis in the presence and absence of symmetries.  

**Note:** we urge the users to work with the `basis_general` objects, since they have enhanced functionality; However, occasionally it might be more convenient to work with the `basis_1d` objects where creating the basis might be a little bit faster.
